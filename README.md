## Skills I can Bring to the table

## Customer Segmentation (RFM)

### RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary Value)

* For data involving purchases (e.g. Service Visits) and time data, you can segment your customers to find the most valuable customers in your current book of business

#### Orders Table:

#### Aggregate Customers by RFM:
* Recency: Days since last service
* Frequency: # of service visits
* Monetary Value: Total income from services visits

#### Create RFM Scores:
* Calculate quartiles for each metric (111 = low recency (visited recently), high frequency (lots of visits), high monetary value)

### How to monetize:

#### Identify customers and business strategies:
* 111: Visit frequently, recently, and high spend. (_loyalty rewards?_)

* 311 & 411: High spend and frequency but hasn't visted in a while. (_retention efforts?_)

* 114: Frequent small visits (_upsell opportunities?_)

* 441: One large repair (_lower maintenance visits to avoid large repairs again_)

* 444: Low value customer (_avoid spending time on low value clients or study into why they're low value_)
